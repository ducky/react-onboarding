# Project Info

Any changes you make will usually be in the [components](../src/components/) folder and is structured like a standard React app.

If you take a look in the [data](../src/data/) folder, you'll see a [games.json](../src/data/games.json) file, and this is going to be used as your initial source of data until you get to a later step, where you'll be pulling this information from a remote api.

The base app here uses [Tabler](https://preview.tabler.io/docs/) as a design library, which is built on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/). Feel free to keep these libraries or roll your own CSS if you want.

**Optional Note** - If you're curious how to bootstrap your own app (or how this app was created), you can check out [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Below is the command used to create this app. We then just added some helpful lint configuration and some Moser branding.

```bash
# You don't have to run this, just showing how it was made.
npm create vite@latest my-app-name -- --template react-ts
```
